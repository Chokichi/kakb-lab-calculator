# Ka/Kb Lab Calculator - Logic Improvements

## ðŸ”§ **Fixed Issues:**

### 1. **Formula Engine Logic**
- **Problem**: Excel cell references (B4, C4, etc.) weren't properly mapped to actual input variables
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive mapping from Excel cell references to meaningful variable names
- **Result**: Formulas now correctly reference the actual pH values and calculated concentrations

### 2. **Input Variable Mapping**
- **Problem**: Students couldn't enter values because the system didn't know which variables to map
- **Solution**: Implemented section-aware mapping that distinguishes between different "pH of mixture" entries
- **Result**: Students can now enter pH values and other direct inputs

### 3. **Trial-Specific Calculations**
- **Problem**: Both trials were using the same variable names
- **Solution**: Added trial-specific suffixes (_trial1, _trial2) to all variables
- **Result**: Each trial is calculated independently with its own input values

## ðŸ§® **How the Logic Works Now:**

### **Student Input Flow:**
1. **Students enter pH values** for each trial (e.g., 2.48 for Trial 1, 2.5 for Trial 2)
2. **App calculates derived values** using the formulas:
   - `[H+] = 10^(-pH)`
   - `[C2H3O2-] = [H+]` (for weak acids)
   - `Keq = ([H+][C2H3O2-])/[HC2H3O2]`
3. **Students can verify** by entering their calculated values
4. **App validates** against the computed values with tolerance

### **Formula Examples:**
- **Original Excel**: `=10^-B4` (pH to [H+])
- **Converted**: `10**-pH_0_50M_HC2H3O2_trial1`
- **Original Excel**: `=B6*B7/B8` (Keq calculation)
- **Converted**: `H_plus_0_50M_trial1*C2H3O2_minus_0_50M_trial1/HC2H3O2_0_50M_trial1`

### **Section-Specific Mapping:**
- **Part 1b**: pH of 0.50 M HC2H3O2 â†’ `pH_0_50M_HC2H3O2`
- **Part 1c**: pH of 0.20 M HC2H3O2 â†’ `pH_0_20M_HC2H3O2`
- **Part 1d**: pH of mixture â†’ `pH_mixture` (section 1d)
- **Part 2b**: pH of mixture â†’ `pH_mixture_unknown_1` (section 2b)
- **Part 2c**: pH of mixture â†’ `pH_mixture_unknown_2` (section 2c)
- **Part 3b**: pH of mixture â†’ `pH_base_mixture` (section 3b)

## âœ… **Current Status:**
- âœ… Two input boxes for each calculation (Trial 1 & Trial 2)
- âœ… Students can enter values in most boxes
- âœ… Real-time validation working for both trials
- âœ… Formula engine correctly converts Excel formulas
- âœ… Section-aware input mapping
- âœ… Independent trial calculations

## ðŸŽ¯ **Test the App:**
1. Open http://localhost:5177/
2. Enter pH values (e.g., 2.48 for Trial 1, 2.5 for Trial 2)
3. Watch as calculated values are computed and validated
4. Enter your calculated values to verify accuracy
5. Adjust tolerance slider to change acceptable error margin

The logic should now work correctly with the Excel formulas and provide proper validation for students!
